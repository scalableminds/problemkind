# Problemkind
What's your most annoying problem? We help you to find the root cause of the problem and encourage others to come up with innovative solutions.

How it works:
1. Got a wallet that is always falling apart, to clumpsy or can't hold your houndrets of bonus cards? Have a vision of a great wallet, but not the incentive to realize it? Create a problem on problemkind.io!
2. People with expertise will review your problem, improve your suggested solution and maybe even start a kickstarter out of your idea.
3. Your problem got successfully solved by others :)
